# knit_rmd
#
# this script takes an Rmd file command line argument
# and compiles it using knitr
#
# Compilation happens in the directory where the Rmd file is located since
# this seems to be a bit of a philosophy, and then we move the file to the
# desired output location

## knit R likes to build to its own directory, let's assemble what the
## name of the output will be
tmp_pdf = here(dirname(rmd_file), out_file)
## knit
render(input = rmd_file, output_file = tmp_pdf, quiet=FALSE)

# --- Move build file --- #
